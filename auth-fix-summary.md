# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Firebase Configuration Issues**
   - Environment variables were properly set but not being correctly loaded
   - Token management was inconsistent
   - Cookie handling was problematic

2. **Authentication Flow Problems**
   - Inconsistent token storage and validation
   - Multiple authentication methods causing conflicts
   - Middleware not properly checking authentication status

3. **Debugging Challenges**
   - No proper way to debug authentication issues
   - Difficult to trace authentication flow

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Firebase Configuration
- Updated `firebase.ts` to properly initialize Firebase
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved token refresh mechanism
- Added environment variable validation

### 2. Authentication Utilities
- Created `auth-utils.ts` with dedicated functions for:
  - Setting authentication cookies
  - Getting cookie values
  - Checking authentication status
  - Refreshing authentication tokens

### 3. Improved Middleware
- Enhanced middleware to check multiple authentication methods
- Added better logging for debugging
- Improved route protection logic
- Added support for public routes

### 4. Authentication Debug Tools
- Created `/test-auth` page for debugging authentication
- Added API endpoint `/api/auth/status` to check server-side authentication
- Created test sign-in functionality
- Added cookie inspection and management

### 5. Header Navigation
- Added debug link in development mode
- Improved styling for better visibility

## How to Use the Debug Tools

1. **Authentication Debug Page**
   - Visit `/test-auth` to see authentication status
   - Check client-side and server-side authentication
   - Test sign-in functionality
   - Clear cookies for testing

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/auth/status` - Check server-side authentication status
   - `/api/auth/test-signin` - Test sign-in functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Stripe Integration**
   - Implement actual Stripe API calls
   - Create API routes for subscription management
   - Update UI to reflect subscription status

2. **Testing**
   - Test authentication flow thoroughly
   - Verify protected routes
   - Test subscription management

3. **Deployment**
   - Ensure environment variables are set in production
   - Configure domain authorization in Firebase Console
